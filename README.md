1) CREATING VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
python -m venv venv
On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

2) After creating the virtual environment the Database had to update according to the postgreSQL username: postgres and password: onlyme10 information.

3) Had to configure Django Rest Framework.

4) Created Model, View, Templates, URLs

5) Applied Migrations and Created a SuperUser with id: admin and password: onlyme10

8) Created REST APi Views

You can run the server after using this : python manage.py runserver and enter http://localhost:8000/admin/
